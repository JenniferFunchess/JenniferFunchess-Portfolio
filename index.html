          Hello Everyone, my name is Jennifer Funchess and I am 25 year old here
          in Atlanta, GA. I was born and raised in the great state of Texas, but
          made my way east to Georgia when I was 18. I attended the University
          of Georgia (Go Dawgs!) for four years, and boy were they the best four
          years of my life! The Grady School of Journalism was an inspiring,
          creative and motivating place that guided me to a wonderful career in
          Advertising.
        </p>
        <p class="font">
          In the Fall of 2017, I started my Advertising career at Omnicom Media
          Group in Altanta Georgia. For the past three years I have been emerged
          in the world of Traditional and Streaming Media. The last three years
          have changed dramatically, and the media world will not stop evolving
          any time soon. My goal for this Full Stack program is to learn and
          execut a coding skill set. I believe that having a strong coding
          foundation will be able to help me be one step ahead in my career
          search. I am excited for the next six months in this Georgia Tech
          coding bootcamp!
